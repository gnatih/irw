        <p><a href="https://watermuseums.net" target="_blank">The Global Network of Water Museums</a> (WAMU-NET) is a non-profit organization based in Venice which aims to <b>re-connect people with water</b> and to all forms of water heritage (both natural and cultural heritages). WAMU-NET was established to promote <b>water awareness education</b> and foster <b>holistic and inter-disciplinary approaches</b> aimed at valuing any kind of water assets and legacies with regard to their natural, social, cultural, artistic, and spiritual dimensions.</p>
        <p>In 2018, WAMU-NET was endorsed by the Council of the Inter-governmental Hydrological Programme as a <b>'flagship initiative' of UNESCO-IHP</b> with the Resolution n.5-XXIII, titled “The Global Network of Water Museum and UNESCO-IHP in support of water sustainability education and water awareness efforts”. In 2021, another Resolution (n.7-XXIV) was endorsed by the Intergovernmental Council of IHP to launch the process of creating a <b>World Inventory of water museums</b>.</p>
        <p>Water museums display a <b>unique repository of different forms of humankind's connections with water and its natural and cultural heritage</b>. They exhibit artefacts, techniques and traditional knowledge aimed at preserving the world's outstanding variety of water-related assets and values. This key knowledge - inherited from countless generations - can still inspire <b>new perceptions and behaviours towards water</b> and therefore encourage <b>more far-sighted water management today</b>.</p>
        <p>WAMU-NET cooperates with more than 70 museums and institutions located in 31 countries worldwide. The WAMU-NET network and all its members are seeking to promote innovative solutions to the global water crisis. While exploring the <b>fundamental values of any kind of water heritage</b> - whether natural or cultural, tangible or intangible - we look forward to re-connecting past water management practices to technical innovation in order to inspire more sustainable futures.</p>
