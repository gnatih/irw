        A new “culture of water” cannot grow without memory. Memories, whether
        they are sensory or emotional, short-term or long-term, material or
        immaterial, are fundamental to our existence as individuals and as
        collective societies. The curatorial team of this exhibition selected a
        number of meaningful images that recall our past water memories and
        reflect on pathways that can help us shape our water futures.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the ornate public fountains and standpipes that provided free water
        to citizens in bustling cities, to the ancient civilizations that have
        flourished along rivers and waterways, water has shaped our landscape
        across time and space, from Europe to Africa, from Asia to the Americas.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, while water is at the core of our bodies, our livelihoods and
        our social relationships, water resources have been dammed, depleted or
        polluted by human activity engrained in engineering paradigms, economic
        development and growing transboundary conflicts. It's likely that in the
        future water will have enormous economic value, as the 'new petroleum'.
      </p>

      <p>
        Climate change has not only accentuated our failure to use and manage
        water wisely, but the dangers of too little or too much water (drought,
        floods and rising sea levels) have posed new challenges to global water
        governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we want to address the next global water challenges, we need to find
        new ways to connect people with their water heritage, so that we can
        build empathy and stimulate new water awareness, supporting the wise and
        judicious use of our water legacies. In the future, water museums have a
        pivotal role to play in this process.

        In all, we received around 600 images and the curatorial team selected
        462 from these to show vibrant and historical relationships with the
        most fundamental element of life. From water as the elixir of Life to
        recreation, Play and education; from water Heritage to our Spiritual and
        sacred connections with water; from water shaping our proximity and
        Belonging to a river, or a place, to the radical Transformations of
        waterscapes witnessed in the last century or so - each category was
        selected by an individual curator after hours of inspiring collective
        discussions.
